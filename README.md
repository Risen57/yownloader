### How to use?
Copy and paste the link of your desired YouTube video and hit the `Download` button. After a wait of 10-15 seconds, your download will start.<br>
<b>To be noted:</b> If the download doesn't start after sometime, it means that your request conflicts with another file. To fix  this, simply reload the website and do the download procedure again.
